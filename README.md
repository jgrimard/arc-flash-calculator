# Arc-Flash-Calculator
### IEEE 1584-2018 based Arc Flash Calculator written in JavaScript.
I wrote this from scratch based on the IEEE 1584-2018 standard since I could not find another open source JavaScript implementation.  The calculations have been tested to 144,000 data points from the official IEEE 1584-2018 excel spreadsheet.
